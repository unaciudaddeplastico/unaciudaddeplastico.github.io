				<section><p style = font-size:33px;>What We Touch, Touches Us:
				Materials, Affects, and Affordances 
				Tom H. Fisher</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
[...] there are very strong indications that this “theoretical” or “cultural” knowledge always is accompanied by <sub1>knowledge of materials</sub1> gained through direct <sub1>physical interaction</sub1> with them / [...] strong liking for or dislike of a material. At the extreme, it may be integrated <sub2>into an individual’s psyche</sub2> in the form of sexual fetishism.
<br><br>
This article builds on <sub1>social-historical studies of plastics</sub1>, and studies in the <sub2>sociology of technology and in the history of design</sub2>.</p>

<p style = font-size:33px;>
				Tom H. Fisher</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
Professor, School of Art & Design - Nottingham Trent University // Professor Fisher's recent PhD supervision is related to the following topics:

consumers' understanding of sustainability
clothing and self-identity
craft practice and fashion design
the history of art education in the UK and China
textile Heritage and contemporary practice
consumption and social practice
fashion and ageing.

				<section><p style = font-size:33px;>Used Plastics</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// Here, <sub2>where the fingers touch most often</sub2>, the subtle matte texture designed into the keys wears away, creating another set of surfaces defined by use, not design. // This <sub1>pattern</sub1> presence relies on the <sub2>user’s presence</sub2>
// The research has focused on plastic materials particularly, but the insight it provides may help us to understand <sub1>the “fine grain” of our relationship to all objects.</sub1></p><p style = font-size:33px;>Literature and Methods</p> <p style = font-size:19px;>// <sub1>some research has done</sub1> around generic processes of technological development rather than to <sub1>explore their meaning for users</sub1> // Over the last fifteen years, some writers have taken recent formulations and <sub2>uses of plastic to be symptomatic of postmodern times</sub2> (Jean Baudrillard - <sub1>System of Objects</sub1> /  Jean-Francois Lyotard) // [...] this research seeks to describe <sub2>consumers’ relationships to materials </sub2> </p> <p style = font-size:33px;>Data</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// British consumers are significantly influenced by the <sub2>folk knowledge that exists about the plastics</sub2> from which the accoutrements of contemporary life are frequently made // [...] <sub1>the distinctive contribution</sub1> of this work would be to systematically revie_w the discourses that have grown up around plastics, and to note <sub2>how contemporary consumers deploy them</sub2> in particular circumstances // [...] It is possible to identify moments when the participants employ three discursive “clusters” which refer to <sub1>modernity/progress</sub1>, <sub2>authenticity/imitation</sub2>, and <sub1>health/hygiene.</sub1> </p> 

</section>
				<section><p style = font-size:33px;>Taste </p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// “tacky” to denote <sub2>the transgression of taste standards</sub2> implied by using a plastic objects in food //  Participants interacted with them sensually, they touched them and explored them with their fingers, and they made reference to their characteristic sounds and smells.</p> <p style = font-size:33px;>The Senses </p><p style = font-size:19px;>// The usage of the word “tacky” allows us to explore this sensorial dimension to <sub2>judgments of instrumental fitness.</sub2>// This negativity is telling. Physical tackiness is likely to be unwelcome and to <sub1>elicit disgust</sub1> in a civilized individual—a negative affect. //  <sub2>Cultural and sensorial elements</sub2> mix in this relationship. The interview_s and other data contain many instances where cultural and sensorial aspects of plastics coexist. </p> 

<p style = font-size:33px;>Gibsonian Affordances—Exploration </p><p style = font-size:19px;>// J. J. Gibson’s concept of the <sub2>“affordance”</sub2> offers a framework throug which we can understand <sub1>how these different registers of meaning can coexist</sub1> in our perception of objects and their materials. // <sub2>we do not perceive the function of things in the abstract</sub2> by itemizing their particular qualities, but we perceive their <sub1>“affordance”—what they particularly allow us to do.</sub1> [...] perception of the environment is <sub1>inseparable</sub1> from proprioception of one’s own body—[...] <sub2>egoreception and extoreception are reciprocal.</sub2> </p>

<section><p style = font-size:33px;>Plastic Capitalism</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// <sub2>Because of the economic importance of innovation to capitalism</sub2>, design continually presents us with new materials in new circumstances // seems like the concept <sub1>'innovative' is used in the context of capitalism production.</sub1> //  As Heft puts it, analyzing Gibson’s ideas in the light of Merleau Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception, as adults <sub2>we explore the world with “cultured bodies”
with which we play out en-cultured intentions.</sub2> So the <sub1>affordance of an artifact—or material—means we use it to suit our physical and psychic needs</sub1>, both because of its physical properties and because of
the “heritage” that is associated with it.</p> 

<p style = font-size:33px;>Fetishists’ Perception of Plastic’s Objective Properties</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// [...] the fetishists used a particularly telling group of <sub2>words to describe the surface quality</sub2> of PVC.22 Along with “glossy,” they used“oily,” “fatty,” “buttery-smooth,” “slick,” and“sticky.” // Jean-Paul Sartre uses <sub1>this type of substance</sub1> to illustrate his discussion of the phenomenon of viscosity that he calls
“the slimy.”</p> 

<p style = font-size:33px;>Sweat and Stickiness: To a Sense of Dubious Margins</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// [...] It is common to dislike the sweat that some plastics make evident and, by association, <sub2>to dislike the plastic.</sub2> // In a design context, this “making an issue of our margins”can be positive—”high-touch”plastics for control surfaces; negative—sticky“tackiness”; or ironic—the gratuitous use of rubber in fashion. But all rely on the same objective properties of the materials.</p> 

</section>

<section><p style = font-size:33px;>The Disposal of Degraded Plastic Objects</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// An obvious consequence of a negative reaction to plastic objects that are read as <sub2>potentially contaminating</sub2> is that they are <sub1>reclassified as waste</sub1>. This research has not concentrated on the moment of reclassification, but because others’ feelings in principle are inaccessible to direct enquiry, <sub2>introspection has been used to explore the disgust reaction mentioned above.</sub2> This elucidated the relationship of the disgust emotion to properties of materials once they are reclassified as rubbish.  // </p> 

<p style = font-size:33px;>Summary and Conclusions
</p><p style = font-size:19px;>
// This research has shown that <sub1>materials in themselves are significant for consumers’</sub1> reception of objects, and can be the focus of <sub2>quite strong feelings.</sub2> // Degraded
objects demonstrate that to say that <sub2>plastics are evaluated positively as the vehicles for the fulfillment of consumerist desire</sub2>; or negatively, when they become waste, or as an aesthetic affront when we “wouldn’t be seen dead” with them are over-simplifications. </p>
